This is the Titanic project from Kaggle for Machine Learning.  I'm using this file as a practice for analyzing datasets as well as practicing statistical analysis methods.  

```{r include =FALSE}
#import the training data set
data <- read.csv("train.csv")

#load packages 

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
