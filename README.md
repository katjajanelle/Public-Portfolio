My name is Katja Janelle and I'm an experienced systems analyst with a passion for using data to learn, explore, and solve problems. 

I have a Master's of Science in Business Analytics from Seattle University where I was taught SQL, R, and statistical analysis. I used those skills to strengthen my professional skills as a systems analsyt but it ignited a curiousity in moving towards a data science career path. 

This repository is a showcase of my work with PL SQL and R.
